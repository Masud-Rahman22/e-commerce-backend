This project is an Express application written in TypeScript and utilizes ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.

Prerequisites:

Node.js (version 16 or later recommended): https://nodejs.org/en
npm (comes bundled with Node.js)
Installation:

Clone this repository or download the project files.

Open a terminal in the project directory.

Install dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Running the Application:

Start the development server:

Bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will start the application in development mode, automatically compiling TypeScript and restarting the server on code changes. The application will typically be accessible on http://localhost:3000 (the default port).

(Optional) Run tests:

Bash
npm test
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will run unit tests written with your preferred testing framework (not included in this basic setup).

Code Formatting:

The project uses Prettier for code formatting. To automatically format code on save, you can configure your code editor or use the following command:

Bash
npm run format
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Linting:

ESLint is used for code linting. To run ESLint manually:

Bash
npm run lint
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Additional Notes:

This is a basic setup. You can further customize the scripts in package.json to fit your needs.
Consider adding a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
For production deployment, you will need to create a production build and potentially configure a web server.
Dependencies:

Express: Web framework for Node.js
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type safety
ESLint: Static code analysis tool
Prettier: Code formatter
This README provides a starting point for running and developing your Express application with TypeScript and related tools. Refer to the documentation of each dependency for further details.
